Dartastic is an [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) SDK to add standard observability to Dart applications.
Dartastic can be used with any OTel backend, it's standards-compliant.

Flutter developers should use the [Flutterific OpenTelemetry SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterrific_opentelemetry/) which builds on top of Dartastic OTel.

The Dartastic and Flutterrific OTel SDK has been proposed for [Donation to the CNCF](https://github.com/open-telemetry/community/issues/2718).
We need YOU to grow the Dartastic community and make this SDK the standard for Flutter and Dart OTel.
Please use it, submit issues, support us with stars and contribute PRs. We are looking for contributors and maintainers.

[Dartastic OTel](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry) is suitable for Dart backends, CLIs or any
Dart application.

[Dartastic OTel API](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry_api) is the API for the Dartastic OTel SDK.
The `dartastic_opentelemetry_api` exists as a standalone library to strictly adhere to the
OpenTelemetry specification which separates API and the SDK.  All OpenTelemetry API classes on in
`dartastic_opentelemetry_api`.

[Flutterrific OTel](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterrific_opentelemetry) adds Dartastic OTel to Flutter apps with ease.  Sign Up at Dartastic.io for early access to this soon to be open source.

[Dartastic.io](https://dartastic.io) is an OpenTelemetry backend based on Elastic with a generous free tier.

Dartastic and Flutterrific OTel are made with 💙 by Michael Bushe at [Mindful Software](https://mindfulsoftware.com).

Mindful Software offers paid support, consulting and developing on Flutter, OpenTelemetry and UI Architecture.

## Getting started

Include this in your pubspec.yaml:
```
dependencies:
  dartastic_opentelemetry: ^0.9.3
```

The entrypoint to the SDK is the `OTel` class.  `OTel` has static "factory" methods for all
OTel API and SDK objects.  `OTel` needs to be initialized first to point to an OpenTelemetry
backend.  Initialization does a lot of work under the hood including gathering a rich set of
standard resources for any OS that Dart runs in.  It prepares for the creation of the global
default `TracerProvider` with the serviceName and a default `Tracer`, both created on first use.
All configuration, include Trace and Metric exporters, can be made in code via `OTel.initialize()`.  
Codeless configuration can be done with standard OpenTelemetry environmental variables either 
through POSIX variable or `-D` or `--define` for Dart or with `--dart-define` for Flutter apps.

## Environment Variables

Dartastic OpenTelemetry ~~supports~~ is working on support for all standard OpenTelemetry environment variables as defined in the [OpenTelemetry Specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).

Environment variables provide a convenient way to configure OpenTelemetry without hardcoding values. 
All environment variable names are available as strongly-typed constants in the SDK for compile-time 
safety and IDE autocomplete. See `lib/src/environment/env_constants.dart` for a complete list.

### How It Works

Dart environment variables can be set in two ways:

1. **System Environment Variables** (Non-web only): Traditional POSIX environment variables
   ```bash
   export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   dart run
   ```

2. **Compile-time Constants** (All platforms including Flutter web): Passed during compilation/execution

   **For Dart commands** (`dart run`, `dart compile`, `dart test`):
   ```bash
   # Using --define (or -D shorthand)
   dart run --define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   dart compile exe -D=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service -o myapp
   dart test -DOTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   ```

   **For Flutter commands**:
   ```bash
   # Flutter uses --dart-define (note the different flag name)
   flutter run --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   flutter build apk --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-service
   ```

**Priority**: Compile-time constants (`--define` or `--dart-define`) take precedence over system environment variables. 
Explicit parameters to `OTel.initialize()` override both.  Thus, POSIX env vars cannot override `--dart-define`s and
neither POSIX env vars nor `--dart-define`s can override code.  This is sensible and reduces security vectors.

**Web Support**: Flutter web and Dart web only support compile-time constants (`--define` or `--dart-define`), as browser environments don't have access to system environment variables.

### Using Environment Variable Constants

All OpenTelemetry environment variable names are available as typed constants:

```dart
import 'package:dartastic_opentelemetry/dartastic_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() {
  // Reference constants instead of strings
  final serviceName = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelServiceName);
  final endpoint = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelExporterOtlpEndpoint);
  
  print('Service: $serviceName');
  print('Endpoint: $endpoint');
}
```

Constants are defined for all 74 OpenTelemetry environment variables. See `lib/src/environment/env_constants.dart` for the complete list.

### Usage Examples

#### Dart Application with Environment Variables

Note the ',' in OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES for POSIX env vars but a ';' for --dart-define.  This is due to a Dart quirk.

```bash
# Set environment variables
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-backend-service
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.version=1.2.3,deployment.environment=prod"
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otel-collector:4318
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=http/protobuf
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=your-key
export OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run your application
dart run bin/my_app.dart
```

#### Flutter Application with --dart-define

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-flutter-app \
  --dart-define=OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="service.version=1.2.3;deployment.environment=prod"
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://otel-collector:4317 \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL=grpc \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS=api-key=your-key
```

#### Flutter Web (requires --dart-define)

```bash
# Web MUST use --dart-define (environment variables don't work in browsers)
flutter run -d chrome \
  --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=my-web-app \
  --dart-define=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://collector:4318
```

#### Combining Both (--dart-define wins)

```bash
# Environment variable
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=from-environment

# --dart-define takes precedence
dart run --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=from-dart-define

# Result: Uses "from-dart-define"
```

#### In Code

```dart
import 'package:dartastic_opentelemetry/dartastic_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() async {
  // OTel.initialize() automatically reads environment variables
  // when parameters are not explicitly provided
  await OTel.initialize();
  
  // Environment variables are read automatically:
  // - OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
  // - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
  // - OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL
  // - And 90+ others...
  
  // Explicit parameters override environment variables
  await OTel.initialize(
    serviceName: 'explicit-service',  // Overrides OTEL_SERVICE_NAME
    endpoint: 'https://override:4318', // Overrides OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
  );
  
  // You can also read environment variables directly
  final endpoint = EnvironmentService.instance.getValue(otelExporterOtlpEndpoint);
  print('Using endpoint: $endpoint');
}
```

### Testing with Environment Variables

Integration tests can use real environment variables:

```bash
# Run tests with environment variables
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=test-service dart test

# Run tests with --dart-define
dart test --dart-define=OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=test-service

# Run the provided integration test script
./tool/test_env_vars.sh
```

The SDK includes an integration test suite (`test/integration/environment_variables_test.dart`) and a test script (`tool/test_env_vars.sh`) that demonstrates proper environment variable usage.

### Minimal Code Example

```dart
import 'package:dartastic_opentelemetry/dartastic_opentelemetry.dart';

void main() async {
  // Initialize - automatically reads environment variables
  await OTel.initialize();

  // Get the default tracer
  final tracer = OTel.tracer();

  // Create a span
  final span = tracer.startSpan('my-operation');
  
  try {
    // Your code here
    await doWork();
  } catch (e, stackTrace) {
    span.recordException(e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    span.setStatus(SpanStatusCode.error, 'Operation failed');
  } finally {
    span.end();
  }
}
```

Since dartastic_opentelemetry exports all the classes of `opentelemetry_api`, refer to
`opentelemetry_api` for documentation of API classes.

See the `/example` folder for more examples.

## OpenTelemetry Metrics API

The Metrics API in OpenTelemetry provides a way to record measurements about your application. These measurements can be exported later as metrics, allowing you to monitor and analyze the performance and behavior of your application.

### Concepts

- **MeterProvider**: Entry point to the metrics API, responsible for creating Meters
- **Meter**: Used to create instruments for recording measurements
- **Instrument**: Used to record measurements
  - Synchronous instruments: record measurements at the moment of calling their APIs
  - Asynchronous instruments: collect measurements on demand via callbacks

### Instrument Types

- **Counter**: Synchronous, monotonic increasing counter (can only go up)
- **UpDownCounter**: Synchronous, non-monotonic counter (can go up or down)
- **Histogram**: Synchronous, aggregable measurements with statistical distributions
- **Gauge**: Synchronous, non-additive value that represents current state
- **ObservableCounter**: Asynchronous version of Counter
- **ObservableUpDownCounter**: Asynchronous version of UpDownCounter
- **ObservableGauge**: Asynchronous version of Gauge

### Usage Pattern

Similar to the Tracing API, the metrics API follows a multi-layered factory pattern:

1. **API Layer**: Defines interfaces and provides no-op implementations
2. **SDK Layer**: Provides concrete implementations
3. **Flutter Layer**: Adds UI-specific functionality

The API follows the pattern of using factory methods for creation rather than constructors:

```dart
// Get a meter from the meter provider
final meter = OTel.meterProvider().getMeter('component_name');

// Create a counter instrument
final counter = meter.createCounter('my_counter');

// Record measurements
counter.add(1, {'attribute_key': 'attribute_value'});
```

For asynchronous instruments:

```dart
// Create an observable counter
final observableCounter = meter.createObservableCounter(
  'my_observable_counter',
  () => [Measurement(10, {'attribute_key': 'attribute_value'})],
);
```

### Understanding Metric Types and When to Use Them

| Instrument Type         | Use Case                                                        | Example                          |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Counter                 | Count things that only increase                                 | Request count, completed tasks   |
| UpDownCounter           | Count things that can increase or decrease                      | Active requests, queue size      |
| Histogram               | Measure distributions                                           | Request durations, payload sizes |
| Gauge                   | Record current value                                            | CPU usage, memory usage          |
| ObservableCounter       | Count things that only increase, collected on demand            | Total CPU time                   |
| ObservableUpDownCounter | Count things that can increase or decrease, collected on demand | Memory usage                     |
| ObservableGauge         | Record current value, collected on demand                       | Current temperature              |

## Integration with Dartastic/Flutterrific

This API implementation follows the same pattern as the tracing API, where the creation of objects is managed through
factory methods. This allows for a clear separation between API and SDK, and ensures that the metrics functionality
can be used in a no-op mode when the SDK is not initialized.
